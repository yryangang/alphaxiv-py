# alphaXiv-py Specs

This directory is the source of truth for accepted behavior in `alphaxiv-py`.
Implementation PRs must update the matching feature spec before or alongside any
SDK or CLI behavior change.

Phase 0 creates the scaffold and checker only. It does not change SDK or CLI
behavior.

## Required Feature Spec Sections

Every file under `specs/features/` must include:

- `## Status`
- `## Endpoint Evidence`
- `## Acceptance Criteria`
- `## Validation Commands`

Run the checker before handoff:

```bash
uv run python scripts/check_specs.py
```

Focused checker tests:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_check_specs.py -q
```
